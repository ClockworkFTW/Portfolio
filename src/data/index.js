Anyone who signs up can add their own spots or enrich existing spots by updating them with more information. This app helped me learn about user authentication, CRUD operations, relational databases, and integrating API's",

One game consists of a few rounds in which every round someone has to draw their chosen word and others have to guess it to gain points! The person with the most points at the end of game will then be crowned as the winner! This project taught me about web sockets, HTML canvases, and complex algorithm logic to keep track of the game state.",

I also learned how to schedule the scrapping task using a cron job which runs twice per day to keep the data as up to date as possible",
